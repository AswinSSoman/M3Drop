M3D - Michaelis-Menten Modelling of Dropouts for scRNASeq

This is an R package providing functions for fitting a modified Michaelis-Menten equation to the pattern of dropouts observed in a single-cell sequencing experiment and subsequent analyses including: identifying biased under-quantification of genes, and fast identification of differentially expressed genes. Visualizations are automatically produced.
