M3Drop - Michaelis-Menten Modelling of Dropouts for scRNASeq

This is an R package providing functions for fitting a modified Michaelis-Menten (MM) equation to the pattern of dropouts observed in a single-cell sequencing experiment.

In addition analyses based on the MM equation, such as identifying differentially expressed genes or biased quantification, are provided with automatically generated visualizations. 

For comparison, the algorithm presented in Brennecke et al (2015) for detection of significantly highly variable genes is included.
